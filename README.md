The 'Points System' project is like any other banking script concept, except with points.

This repository is another small project of mine, I'm putting all I know about Python and JSON into this and will make changes in the future.

## For Those Who'd Like To Use The Program:
**REQUIREMENTS:** (For local machines/terminals)
- You must have Python installed on your machine.

**HOW TO USE:**
- You can initiate the project either on your computer or on an online IDE editor using `python3 main.py` in the command line (Please make sure you have Python installed if you are running this code locally on your computer!).
- Next, choose the "Sign-up" option and create a unique and memorable sign-in ID for you to sign back into your make-shift account.
- Create a password, do not forget it!
** After entering the information, you'll be ready to go! When you are asked if you want to claim bonus points, I recommend you claim them!
* LAST: "Slash" commands are available, view them with "/help".
