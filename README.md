The 'Points System' project is like any other banking script concept, except with points.

This repository is another small project of mine, I'm putting all I know about Python and JSON into this and will make changes in the future.

## For Those Who'd Like To Use The Program:
**REQUIREMENTS:** (For local machines/terminals)
- You must have Python installed on your machine.

**HOW TO USE:**
- You can initiate the project either on your computer or on an online IDE editor using `python3 main.py` in the command line.
- Next, enter a username you can remember when the program asks for one. After you choose a username and start up the program, you can use commands. Just type "/help" to view all the available commands.
